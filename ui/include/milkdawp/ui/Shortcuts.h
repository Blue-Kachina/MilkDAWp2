/// differs per window (an Output window fullscreens itself; the plugin
/// editor opens an Output window fullscreen instead, since a host-framed
/// editor can never fullscreen itself) -- that routing is each window's own

/// window state.
///
/// `isAppShell` gates Space: every DAW binds Space to transport, so the
/// plugin must never claim it (§4.9) -- only the standalone app shell
/// should pass `isAppShell = true`.
///
/// The single-letter shortcuts (L, S, H, P) only fire unmodified, per §4.9's
/// "unmodified letters only" rule; F11/Esc/arrows/Space are unaffected by
/// modifiers, since the table places no such restriction on them.

/// Callers are responsible for the two preconditions §4.9 lists that this
/// function has no way to check itself: only call this while the
/// visualization or drawer has keyboard focus, and never while a text field
/// is being edited.
