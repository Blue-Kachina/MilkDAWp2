/// The reveal/hide/pin state machine behind `ControlDrawer`, deliberately
/// kept free of JUCE (no `Component`, no `Timer`) so it is a plain,
/// deterministic unit under test -- the roadmap's own requirement for this
/// item. `ControlDrawer` (later in Phase 2.11/3.3/4.1) is a thin JUCE
/// wrapper: it forwards `Component::mouseEnter`/`mouseDown` to
/// `onPointerActivity()`, calls `tick()` from a `Timer` callback with
/// `Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes() / 1000.0`, and reads `state()` to
/// decide what to paint.
///
/// Time is never read internally -- every method that needs "now" takes it
/// as a parameter -- so tests can drive the clock exactly instead of
/// sleeping.
///
/// Rules encoded here, from §4.9's table:
///  - Reveal on hover or tap; auto-hide after `autoHideSeconds` of no
///    pointer activity, but only once pinned.
///  - Pinned suppresses auto-hide entirely, and 'H' (toggleRevealHide) is a
///    no-op while pinned -- unpin first ('P' / setPinned(false)), *then*
///    hide. This is deliberate: the whole point of pinning is that the
///    drawer can't disappear out from under an in-progress knob edit.
///  - First-run reveal: the drawer starts open and stays open regardless of
///    elapsed time until the very first interaction of any kind (pointer
///    activity, a pin toggle, or a reveal/hide toggle) -- after that,
///    ordinary timer-based auto-hide applies.
