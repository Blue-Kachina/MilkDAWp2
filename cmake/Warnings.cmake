# cmake/Warnings.cmake
#
# Provides `milkdawp_warnings`, an INTERFACE target that turns on
# warnings-as-errors (D5) for MilkDAWp's own targets. Link it PRIVATE into
# milkdawp_core/engine/ui/plugin/app targets, never into third-party targets
# (JUCE, projectM) so their warnings can't fail our build.
#
# JUCE is fetched with FetchContent's SYSTEM option (cmake/FetchJuce.cmake),
# so its headers are treated as system includes and won't trip -Wpedantic
# et al. when included from our translation units.
