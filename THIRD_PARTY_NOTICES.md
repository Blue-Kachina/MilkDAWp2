# Third-party notices

MilkDAWp 2 is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE` / D10). It links
against the following third-party components. Full licence texts for
dependencies actually bundled in a release installer are regenerated at
build/packaging time (Phase 6.2-6.4, §9) from each vcpkg port's copyright
file; this document is the human-curated index of what's used and why.

| Component | License | Linkage | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| [JUCE 9](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) | AGPL-3.0 (open-source path) | Statically compiled in via `FetchContent` (`cmake/FetchJuce.cmake`) | Pinned tag + commit hash |
| [projectM 4](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) | LGPL-2.1 | **Dynamically** linked (required by LGPL; see `triplets/*.cmake` and `cmake/ProjectMDependency.cmake`) | vcpkg, pinned baseline |
| [Catch2 v3](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) | BSL-1.0 | Test-only, not shipped in any release binary | `FetchContent` (`cmake/FetchCatch2.cmake`) |
| zlib | zlib | Dynamically linked via vcpkg when projectM is enabled (§4.11); otherwise JUCE's bundled copy | vcpkg / JUCE |
| libpng | libpng-2.0 | Dynamically linked via vcpkg when projectM is enabled (§4.11); otherwise JUCE's bundled copy | vcpkg / JUCE |
| freetype, GLEW, and projectM's other transitive dependencies | various (see each port) | Dynamically linked via the `*-dynamic` vcpkg triplets | vcpkg |

## Why projectM must be dynamically linked

projectM is LGPL-2.1. Statically linking an LGPL library into a
non-(L)GPL-compatible-licensed binary would extend LGPL obligations to the
whole binary; MilkDAWp avoids that by linking it as a shared library on every
platform (enforced by the `*-dynamic` triplets and checked at configure time).
The compiled shared library, its licence, and a written offer for its source
(if not already satisfied by pointing at the upstream project) ship alongside
every installer (Phase 6.2-6.4).

## Generating a release's full notices

Phase 6 packaging generates a complete, per-release third-party notices file
from the actual dependency set resolved by vcpkg for that build (license
files live under `vcpkg_installed/<triplet>/share/*/copyright`). This file is
the curated summary for contributors and reviewers, not the shipped legal
document.
